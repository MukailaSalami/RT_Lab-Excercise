Please note the following

 - Hacker News API only gives maximum of 20 results per search
 
 - To utilze the full flavor of the service call features, I used Axios as opposed to the traditional FETCH 
 to fetch the data from HN News API. Please npm install Axios as I will not be uploading my node_modules folder
 to conserve space and download time. I will however include my package.json file

 - You can use the store.getState() to view the snapshot of my Redux store storing the entered values in an array.
 Please note that redux module also should be npm installed

 - As emphasis is not laid on UI, I used the HTML primitive table and other primitive UI elements to search and
 display data. Also Unit Testing excercise has not been implemented

 - For the sake of this excercise, all components used reside in the App.js file, in prod, they will be modularized 
 into their own components folder and imported

- Note that since HN API utilizes some predictive text technology to provide results 
there are some instances where users entry might not directly match the outcome as HN tries to 
predict their entry to display the outcome. For example user Entry 'deznk' will be interepreted by HN
as 'Denk' thus will bring outcome relating to 'Denk'

- In order to prevent code injection attack on the 'search' input field, I have handled this in the .catch 
block through contingency block of code
